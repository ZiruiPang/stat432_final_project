# stat432_final_project
In this project, two datasets are used. One of them contains some basic data about the city of Los Angeles, which has been uploaded here and is named **project432dataset.csv**.

The other dataset is too large (nearly 500 MB), so download links are provided as follows:  
- [Crime Data from 2010 to 2019](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2010-to-2019)  
- [Los Angeles Crimes 2010â€“2019 (Cleaned Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoskypritidis/los-angeles-crimes-201019-cleaned-datased)
